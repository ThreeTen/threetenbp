/**
 * A date-time with a zone offset from UTC/Greenwich in an arbitrary chronology,
 * intended for advanced globalization use cases.
 * <p>
 * <b>Most applications should declare method signatures, fields and variables
 * as {@link OffsetDateTime}, not this interface.</b>
 * <p>
 * A {@code ChronoOffsetDateTime} is the abstract representation of an offset date-time
 * where the {@code Chrono chronology}, or calendar system, is pluggable.
 * The date-time is defined in terms of fields expressed by {@link DateTimeField},
 * where most common implementations are defined in {@link ChronoField}.
 * The chronology defines how the calendar system operates and the meaning of
 * the standard fields.
 *
 * <h4>When to use this interface</h4>
 * The design of the API encourages the use of {@code OffsetDateTime} rather than this
 * interface, even in the case where the application needs to deal with multiple
 * calendar systems. The rationale for this is explored in detail in {@link ChronoLocalDate}.
 * <p>
 * Ensure that the discussion in {@code ChronoLocalDate} has been read and understood
 * before using this interface.
 *
 * <h4>Implementation notes</h4>
 * This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 * All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 * Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.
 *
 * @param <C> the chronology of this date-time
